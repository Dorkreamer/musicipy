- `-u` `--url` -> Sets the YouTube URL you want to download from, if not specified it'll ask upon execution.
- `-n` `--name` -> Gives your file a specific name, if not specified it'll use a sanitized version of the video's title.
- `-l` `--location` -> Specifies where the file should be downloaded, if not specified it'll download the file at your current working directory.
